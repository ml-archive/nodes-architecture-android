 * Created by bison on 10/10/17.
 *
 * This is a sample of how to use the interactor base classes to implement a new interactor
 * In this case its simply adds together two numbers specified in the Input data class
 *
 * Interactors always run in the background and usually publish their results to the mainthread
 * (much like an asynctask)
